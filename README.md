# eyewitness_confidence_delay
Confidence Accuracy Characteristic curves to determine if a delay in collecting confidence after an eyewitness makes an identification on a lineup effects their confidence accuracy relationship (how predictive confidence is of accuracy) 

As part of my MRes research project, I collected data through a Qualtrics survey.
The study is currently live - if you would like to participate please do so before reading on. It can still be completed here:

This project was interested in how delay affects the confidence accuracy relationship of mock crime eyewitnesses.
